Thanks for reading my code
This application is used to display the Galton Board experiment

Some notice in application:

Button:
    Start -- start to display
    Pause -- pause the display
    Clear -- clear current axes
    Exit --quit the application
    
Knob:
    NumberKnob -- choose the number of balls
    VelocityKnob -- choose the velocity of balls

One big deficiency is that a figure will show up when you press the continue button,because I use uiresume.
